# Description

Given a string containing only lowercase english letters, write a function that removes any adjacent duplicate characters in the string and returns a new string that is free of adjacent duplicates.

***For example:***

The string “abbaca” should return “ca”.

# Explanation:

*	In the first case we remove the adjacent duplicates “bb” from the string “abbaca”, and are left with the string “aaca”
*	In the second case, we remove the adjacent duplicates “aa” from the string “aaca” and are left with the string “ca”
*	Finally, we return the final string “ca”

# Other examples:

-	The string “xyaaya” should return “xa”
